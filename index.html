        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I`m an English teacher. I hold a degree in Psychology, which has given me a unique perspective on human behavior and learning. It has also taught me the value of empathy, patience, and effective communication when working with students of all
            ages. As an English teacher, I have had the privilege of helping students of various levels at Red Balloon. I am the teacher for K1.1 - TB, but also substituted other teachers from J2, T1, T2, T3, T4 and T6 along the year. I believe that teaching
            is not only about acquiring knowledge but also nurturing creativity, adaptability and critical thinking. When I'm not in the classroom, I enjoy expending time with my children and playing games, learning new languages, and reading graphic
            nowels. I'm inspired by the potential for positive change that every day in the classroom brings, and I'm excited to continue my journey in education, making a lasting impact on the lives of my students. Thank you for visiting my portfolio,
            and I look forward to sharing my teaching experiences and achievements with you.</p>

        <h2>Assisting</h2>
        <p>When assisting it is my job to help teachers, sometimes inside the classroom with their students while they need to go somewhere else or around the school, walking students to others places of the school such as during arrival and departure, when
            they need to talk to the coordinator, their parents or other employees of the school, when students need medical attention I take them to the reception where we have medications, band-aids, or can contact their parents. I also help the coordination
            by decorating the school and talking to students about the events that we are having at the school, as during the events coordinating activities and games.</p>
