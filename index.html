        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I`m an English teacher. I hold a degree in Psychology, which has given me a unique perspective on human behavior and learning. It has also taught me the value of empathy, patience, and effective communication when working with students of all
            ages. As an English teacher, I have had the privilege of helping students of various levels at Red Balloon. I am the teacher for K1.1 - TB, but have also substituted teachers on J2, T1, T2, T3, T4 and T6 levels along the year. I believe that
            teaching is not only about sharing knowledge but also nurturing creativity, adaptability and critical thinking. When I'm not in the classroom, I enjoy spending time with my children and playing games, learning new languages, and reading graphic
            nowels. I'm inspired by the potential for positive change that every day in the classroom brings, and I'm excited to continue my journey in education, making a lasting impact on the lives of my students. Thank you for visiting my portfolio,
            and I look forward to sharing my teaching experiences and achievements with you.</p>

        <h2>Assisting</h2>
        <p>When assisting it is my job to help teachers, sometimes inside the classroom with their students while they need to go somewhere else or around the school, walking students to others places of the school such as during arrival and departure, when
            they need to talk to the coordinator, their parents or other employees of the school, when students need medical attention I take them to the reception where we have medications, band-aids, or can contact their parents. I also help the coordination
            by decorating the school and talking to students about the events that we are having at the school, as during the events coordinating activities and games.</p>

        <h2>Assessment</h2>
        <p>This year at Red Balloon was both challenging and exciting.
            <br><br>Preparing exercises for the students is still a challenge for me. I've been learning how to assess the core content in each task and how to properly measure the amount of exercises that students can solve every class.
            <br><br>Forming bonds with the older students was harder for me, but when in smaller groups I felt like there were more opportunities to do so. Students from small groups such as T6 MD were open and spoke their minds freely about many subjects
            while larger classes like T3 and T4 would interact only among themselves in my presence.
            <br><br>As for kids, the biggest challenges I faced this year were classroom management and student engagement. In K1.1TB the older students were more engaged and more physical while the younger were shier and wouldn't join the group on some
            of the activities when they felt hard to fit in. A couple of students are very energetic and can't stay seated during longer activities and others would lie down on the floor or hide under the table. I sometimes felt pressured to finish the
            activities on time so we could move on to the next activity, but as we started to form a connection I could see that the students may need to socialize and develop their skills for a little longer than planned.
            <br><br> My hopes for 2024 are that time will be more easily managed, so I can continue to develop my teaching skills.
